This is my Final Year Project. Currently I am working on GUI of the Project. The project is all about predicting the price of a house with the help of various parameters like #Bedrooms, Area, Requirement Structures( like Garage, #Floors etc.), Condition of House and so on.

In this project, user will give their choice through input boxes and those data will be passed for the prediction of price of House.

The prediction of price will be done with the help of algorithms designed in Machine Learning. Use of various alogirthms like Linear Regrresion, SVM, XGBoost etc for designing the algorithms.

The Project is divided into three parts among the three team members as follows:
Akash Sati : Integration between FrontEnd and BackEnd.
Atul Ranjan : FrontEnd Development and Algorithm Design.
Rohit Kumar Mishra : Algorithm Designing and Machine Learning Implementation.
