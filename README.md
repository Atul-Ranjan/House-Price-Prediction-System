House Price Prediction System is developed in order to find the correct price of houses in some localities.

The prediction of price will be done with the help of algorithms designed in Machine Learning. Use of various alogirthms like Linear Regrresion, SVM, XGBoost etc for designing the algorithms.

Concepts Required:
1. Pyhton
   >>Libraries:
     numpy
     pandas
     matplotlib
     scikit-learn

2. Machine Learning
   >>Algorithms:
     Linear Regression
     XGBOOST
     LASSO
     ELASTIC NET
